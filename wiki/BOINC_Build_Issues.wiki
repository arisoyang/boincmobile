== Known issues and errors with the cross compilation of BOINC ==

Most of the issues with cross compiling BOINC are due to the host system environment setup and how the spoofing environment is setup.

==Here is a list of some to the issues you might have encountered, with some hack fixes==

===openssl ===

*Error Message*
{{{
> crypt.cpp:33:25: error: openssl/ssl.h: No such file or directory
> crypt.cpp:34:25: error: openssl/md5.h: No such file or directory
> crypt.cpp:35:25: error: openssl/bio.h: No such file or directory
}}}

*Fix*
{{{
cd boinc/lib
> ln -s /usr/local/ssl/include/openssl/ openssl
}}}


=== lnsl ===

*Error Message*
{{{
-lnsl -lpthread -lm  
/scratchbox/compilers/arm-linux-cs2008q3-72/bin/../lib/gcc/arm-none-linux-gnueabi/4.3.2/../../../../arm-none-linux-gnueabi/bin/ld: cannot find -lssl
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
}}}

*Explanation*
The -l flag is essentially a shorthand for "look for lib<whatever>.so ||
lib<whatever>.a in all the configured library directories". "Configured
library directories" are whatever has been configured in your linker, plus
the arguments to any -L options you might have.


*Fix*
{{{
ln -s /usr/local/ssl/lib/libcrypto.a /usr/lib/libcrypto.a
ln -s /usr/local/ssl/lib/libssl.a /usr/lib/libssl.a
}}}
